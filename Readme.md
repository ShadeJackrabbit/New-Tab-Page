# New Tab Start Page
A start page for your browser to be used as a New Tab replacement. Built not as an extension, but as a web page. You can run it on your own server and use it as your start page.

**How to use?**
You'll need to host it somewhere, then point your home page to it. Hopefully your browser lets you set the home page for your new tabs.

Background images are loaded from the backgrounds folder via PHP.  Icons for links will be loaded using Google's favicon engine.

## Tech
Uses jQuery, which is linked via Google's hosted libraries. PHP is used to serve the web page. Also uses:
